# Voting System 
(REST service to vote for restaurants)

<h2>Постановка задачи:</h2>

Design and implement a REST API using Hibernate/Spring/SpringMVC (or Spring-Boot) without frontend.

Build a voting system for deciding where to have lunch.

* 2 types of users: admin and regular users
* Admin can input a restaurant and it's lunch menu of the day (2-5 items usually, just a dish name and price)
* Menu changes each day (admins do the updates)
* Users can vote on which restaurant they want to have lunch at
* Only one vote counted per user
* If user votes again the same day:
    - If it is before 11:00 we asume that he changed his mind.
    - If it is after 11:00 then it is too late, vote can't be changed
    
Each restaurant provides new menu each day.
